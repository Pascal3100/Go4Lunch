# Go4Lunch
The Go4Lunch app is a collaborative app used by all employees. It allows you to search for a restaurant around you, select the one of your choice by telling your colleagues. Likewise, it is possible to consult the restaurants selected by colleagues in order to join them. A little before lunchtime, the application notifies the various employees to invite them to join their colleagues.
